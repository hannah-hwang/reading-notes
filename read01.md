# About Markdown
***Markdown*** is a markup language that you can use to format and style text.

## Headings

To create a ***heading***, add a number sign (#) before your chosen heading. The number of number signs indicate the level of heading, so the level of the heading decreases with each number sign.

For example:

[# The Largest Heading]

[## The Second Largest Heading]

[### The Smallest Heading]

*note: make sure to add a space between the number sign and your heading

## Styling Text

To style a text, wrap the text with the appropriate symbol needed.

For example:

- To make a text **bold** add two asterisks (**) around the text you want bolded.
- To *italicize* text, add one asterisk (*) around the text.
- To ~~strikethrough~~ text, add two tildes (~~) around the text.
- To **_italicize_ within bolded text** add an underscore (_) around text you want italized within text that is bolded.
- To make all text ***italicized and bolded*** add three asterisks (***) around the text.

## Links
To create a ***link***, wrap the the name of link in brackets [ ], then wrap the URL in parentheses ( ).

## HTML

1. It't important to use semantic elements in HTML because they are elements used for a specific purpose. This makes is easier to identify parts of an HTML file, and makes it easier for screen readers to navigate through a page.
2. There are 6 levels of headings in HTML.
3. The *sup* and *sub* elements can be used when writing dates, chemical formula, and mathematical equations (such as those involving fractions and exponents).
4. The *title* attibute must be added to a *abbr* element in order to provide full expansion of the term.

## CSS

1. CSS can be applied to HTML by using an external stylesheet linked in the HTML, an internal style sheet in the head of the HTML, and by utilizing inline styling in the opening tag od an element.
2. Inline styling should be avoided because it is not an efficient way to style since you have to style each element individually, and makes the file hard to understand.
3. In this code,

    a. h2 is the selector

    b. black and 5px are the CSS declarations

    c. color and padding are the properties

## JavaScript

1. A string variable is data type that a sequence of text enclosed in single quotation marks.
2. 4 different types of JavaScript operators are addition(+), assignment(=), strict equality (===), and not (!).
3. Functions are useful because they allow you to resuse code.

### Conditionals

1. An if statement checks a *condition* and if it evaluates to *true*, then the code block will execute.
2. Using *else if* is a way to provide responses to extra choices/outcomes.
3. 3 different types of comparison operators are === and !== which test if one value is identical or not to another, < and > which test if one value is less than or greater than another, and <= >= which test if one value is less than or equal to/greater than or equal to another.
4. The difference between the logical operators && (AND) and (||) (OR) are that when chaining togther expressions using &&, all expressions need to be true in order for the whole expression to be true, while when using (||), at least one expression needs to be true in order for the whole expression to be true.

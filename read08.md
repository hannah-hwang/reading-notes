# Read: 08 Operations and Loops

## Comparison Operators

A *comparison operator* compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values.

Comparison operators are:

- == (equal)
- !== (not equa)
- === (strict equal)
- !== (strict not equal)
- '>' (greater than)
- '>=' (greater than or equal)
- '<' (less than)
- '<=' (less than or equal)

## Assignment Operators

An *assignment operator* assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. There is the simple assignment operator (=), and compound assignment operators such as the addition operator and division operator.

## For Statement

A *for* loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false

The Structure of a for loop looks like:

for( initial value; condition to evaluate; increment) { code to execute }

- the *initial value* usually initializes one or more loops counters
- if *condition to evaluate* is true, then the loops statements execute

## While Statement

A *while* statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true

The Structure for a while loops looks like:

while ( condition to evaluate is true ){ execute this code }

- the loop stop executing if the condition becomes false

# Read:06 Dynamic Web Pages with JavaScript

***JavaScript*** is an asynchronous, dynamically-typed, interpreted language designed to make web pages dymanic and interactive. It is one of the most common scripting/programming languages.

JavaScript can be used two ways: directly inside the HTML file, or in an external Javascript file that is linked to the HTML file. It is best practices to use it externally.

## Input Output

There are many ways that JavaScript can display text depending on what you input.

- ***alert*** will show up as a pop-up with the text input
- ***document.write*** will display text that is input in the browser
- ***console.log*** text that is input will show up in the console of the browser; warnings and errors will show up here
- ***prompt*** will display a pop-up window where users can write in their responses
- ***confirm*** will display a pop-up window with a yes or no question

## Variables

***Variables*** are containers for storing data.

- *const.* value of variable cannot be changed
- *let* value of variable can be changed

All variables must be identified with a unique name that should be not used more than once.

***Text Strings*** are text values that are written inside single or double quotes. Numbers put in quotes will be treated as text string.

***Conditional Logic***

- If
- Else if (can chain on as many as I need)
- Else

## NoSQL vs SQL

5 Differences between SQL and NoSQL:

- SQL:

1. relational database
2. represents data in the form of tables
3. manages increasing load by increasing CPU, RAM, etc.
4. have predefined schema
5. good for complex query intensive environments

- NoSQL:

1. non-relational database
2. represents data in form of key-value pairs, documents, graphs
3. manages increasing load by adding more servers in the database
4. have dynamic schema for unstructured data
5. don't have standard interfaces to perform compplex queries

# Read: Class 09 Functional Programming

## Funtional Programming Concepts

1. What is functional programming?\
Functional programming is programming model that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids data that be changed.
2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?\
A pure function is a function that returns the same result if given the same argument, and it does not cause any observeable side effects.
3. What are the benefits of a pure function?\
The bebefits of a pure side effect are that they are stable, consistent, and predictable.
4. What is immutability?\
Immutability is being unable to be changed. The state of the data cannot be changed after it is created.
5. What is Referential transparency?\
Referential transparency is if a functions consistently yeilds the same result for the same input.

## Modules and require()

1. What is a module?\
A module is a javaacript file that works like a component.
2. What does the word ‘require’ do?\
'Require' is used to bring in global objects.
3. How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?\
We bring in another module into the file by importing it using the require function.
4. What do we have to do to make a module available?\
To make a module available, we have to export it to the module we want to use it in.

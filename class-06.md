# Read: Class 06 Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

## Object

1. I would describe object as a collection of related data and functionality which usually consists of variables and functions. For example, if your object is *person* you would fill it with details pertaining to person such as name, age, location, etc.
2. Some advantages to creating object literals are that you can transfer a series of structured, related items, and you can identify individual items using a single object rather than typing each item out.
3. Objects are different from arrays in that an object represents characteristics of the variable it is representing, while an array is a collection of data.
4. You would use bracket notation to access an object's property when an object property name is held in a variable.
5. This code would output: Spot is 14 is human years. *This* refers to the current object the code is being written inside. I this code, *this* refers to dog. The advantage of using *this* is allows you to use the same method for every object created.

## DOM

1. *DOM* or the Document Object Model is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document. It refers to websites and HTML elements as objects in a webpage.
2. The relationship between the DOM and JavaScript is that JavaScript uses the DOM to access the document and its elements, and the DOM allows JavaScript to be effective. Elements in a document can be manipulated and changed by JavaScript using the DOM.

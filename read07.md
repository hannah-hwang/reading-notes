## Control Flow

The ***control flow*** is the order that statements in a script are executed. Code is usually run in the order it shows up in the file unless there are structures in place that change the control flow, such as conditionals or loops.

- For example, in conditional structures, the response displayed depends on what the user put in, not on the order of code.

## Function

***Function*** in JavaScript refers to a block of code designed to perform a certain task. It is executed when it it *invoked* or called. Code can be resued as many times with different arguments.

### Syntax

A JavaScript function looks like:

function *name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3)* { code to be executed }

### Return

The function will stop executing when JavaScript reaches a *return* statement

## Expressions and Operators

An *expression* is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value.

There are two types of expressions:

1. expressions that have side effects (ex. assigning values -> x=7)
2. expressions that only evaluate  (ex. 5+6)

*Operators* perform some operation of a single or multiple operands and produce a result

Types of Operators:

- Arithmetic
- Assignment
- Comparison
- Logical
- Conditional
- Type

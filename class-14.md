## CSS Transforms

1. CSS transform allows a developer to position and alter elements. For example, elements can be rotated or scaled.
2. An example to transform is transform:skew, which distorts elements. This can be used to add a diagonal design to webpages.

## CSS Transitions & Animations

1. CSS transition allows a developer to alter the appearance and behavior of an element in multiple frames. There has to be change in state, and each state must be styled differently.
2. CSS animation is different from CSS transition in that animation allows you to set the positions of the element how long it will take the element to get there using one CSS property (@keyframes), while transition required you to define multiple states individually when more control is needed.

# Cool CSS3 Transitions

1. Some benefits to using CSS transitions on websites are that they will improve the page visually, make the page more engaging, and add interactive elements to your page.
2. This topic is important because we will need to be knowledgeable about different ways to use CSS whenever we are developing a website. CSS transform, transition, and animation are things that are used in most webpages, so it will be good to keep this in mind whenever we are working in CSS.

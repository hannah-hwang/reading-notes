## Git
***Git*** is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that stores data in a file system made of snapshots. Saving your project is called a *commit*, which creates a snapshot of the file.

Every change made to a file is tracked by Git, which allows it to detect file corruption or loss of data.

Files in Git exist is three main states:
* Committed: data is securely stored in a local database
* Modified: filehas been changed but not committed to the database
* Staged: prepares a file to be committed

## HTML

1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or content around a anchor tag (\<a>).
2. Rhe href attribute contains the link or web address.
3. Some ways that we can ensure that links on our pages are accessible to all readers are by using clear link wording so that users know what the link will lead to, and by leaving clear signposts when linking to non-HTML resources.

## CSS

1. *Normal flow* refers to the way that webpage elements lay themselves out if the layout has not been changed.
2. A *block-level* element's content fills the available inline space of the parent element and grows long the block dimension to accomodate its content.  *Inline* elements are just the size of the content and don;t appear on new lines.
3. *Static* positioning is the default for every HTML element.
4. An advantage to using absolute positioning on an element is that you can isolate features on a page and not have them interfere with the layout og elements on the page.
5. The key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning is that fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the web page, while absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor.

## JavaScript

1. A function declaration defines a function with the specified parameters, while a function invocation is used to execute a function.
2. A paramater and an argument is the same thing.

## Miscellaneous

1. 2 benefits to paired programming are that it produces higher quality code due to multiple people reviewing the code and giving feedback, and you will learn from fellow students which can improve problem-solving skills as a result of being exposed to new ideas and techniques.

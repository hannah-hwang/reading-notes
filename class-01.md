## Getting Started

1. HTTP sends data between computers through internet connection using TCP/IP.
2. *Parsing* is when the browser send the data it recieves over the network into the DOM or DSSOM. HTML and CSS is parsed by getting the input and builing up a document tree that reflects the different elements. In JavaScript, scripts are parsed into abstract syntax trees.
3. You can find images to add to a website by searching on Google Images. To make sure you aren't using a copyrighted image, use Google's license filter which can be found in the *Tools* button.
4. To create a *string* in JavaScript, enclose the value within single quotation marks. *Numbers* do not need quotes around them.
5 *Variables* are containers that store value. They are important because they allow you to add interactions to your webpage.

## Introduction to HTML

1. An *HTML attribute* is extra information about the element located within the opening tag. Class or href are examples of attributes.
2. An HTML element includes the opening tag, the content, and the closing tag. Tho opening tag contains the name of the element and is wrapped in angle brackets. The content is what is between the opening and closing tag. The closing tag is the same as the opening tag, except it includes a forward slash before the name to indicate the end of the element.
3. An *article* tag and a *section* tag are similar in the they enclose a block of related content together, but a *section* tag is used to break up parts of a page that has a single piece of functionality.

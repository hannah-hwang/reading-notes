## Getting Started

1. HTTP sends data between computers through internet connection using TCP/IP.
2. *Parsing* is when the browser send the data it recieves over the network into the DOM or DSSOM. HTML and CSS is parsed by getting the input and builing up a document tree that reflects the different elements. In JavaScript, scripts are parsed into abstract syntax trees.
3. You can find images to add to a website by searching on Google Images. To make sure you aren't using a copyrighted image, use Google's license filter which can be found in the *Tools* button.
4. To create a *string* in JavaScript, enclose the value within single quotation marks. *Numbers* do not need quotes around them.
5 *Variables* are containers that store value. They are important because they allow you to add interactions to your webpage.

## Introduction to HTML

1. An *HTML attribute* is extra information about the element located within the opening tag. Class or href are examples of attributes.
2. An HTML element includes the opening tag, the content, and the closing tag. Tho opening tag contains the name of the element and is wrapped in angle brackets. The content is what is between the opening and closing tag. The closing tag is the same as the opening tag, except it includes a forward slash before the name to indicate the end of the element.
3. An *article* tag and a *section* tag are similar in the they enclose a block of related content together, but a *section* tag is used to break up parts of a page that has a single piece of functionality.
4. A typical wesite includes *!DOCTYPE html* which indicates a HTML document, a *html* element which is wrapped around the entire content of the page, a *head* element which contains elements that you want to include in the page but does not show up as content, a *meta* element which is metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML elements, a *title* element which sets the title of the browser tab of the page, and a *body* element which contains all of the contents on the page.
5. The *meta* HTML tag can be used when specifying metadata by setting a universal character setter which allows the web page to display any language. Meta elements include name (specifies type of meta element) and content (specifies the actual meta content).

## How to Start to Design a Website

The first step to designing a website is by identifying and asking what you want to accomplish through the website, how the website will help you reach your goals, and what needs to be done in order to reach those goals.

## Semantics

1. An *h1* element should be used over a *span* element to display a top level heading because it gives it a specific meaning and helps screen readers to identify what kind of element it is.
2. The benefits to using semntic tags are that it helps screen readers indentify content in the page which allows visually impaired users to better navigate a page. It also makes looking through code easier since elements are more specific and meaningful.

## JavaScript

1. 2 things that require JavaScript in a browser are adding an animated image and implementing a pop-up window with a prompt.
2. JavaScript can be added to an HTML document in a *script* tag in the footer or where you want the interaction to show up.

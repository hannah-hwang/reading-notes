# Read:04 Structure and HTML

## Wireframing

***Wireframing*** is the process of planning and mapping out the design of a website, app, etc. It is typically hand-drawn sketch via pen and paper or online tools so that is is easy to change and rework. It should be clear and simple as it is the visual guide to the framework and navigation of your website.

## HTML

***HTML*** (HyperText Markup Language) is markup language that consists of elements and tags that make the contents of a web page appear or act a certain way. It is the structure of a web page.

An element consists of an opening tag, a closing tag, the content, and the element itself.

For example:

***Attributes*** contains extra information about the element that doesn't show up is the actual content. Giving and element a *class* attribute allows you to give it an identifier that can be used to target it when styling it.

***Nesting*** is when you put elements inside elements. This can be used to emphasize a certain word or phrase. Make sure to properly clsoe the tag inside the element.

***Empty elements*** have no content, such as the *img* tag which requires no content and closing tag.

## Semantics

***Semantics*** refers to the meaning of a piece of code, and the role it plays in the code. It refers to elements with a specific purpose, rather than elements that can be used for multiple purposes. Using semantic code makes it easier to read code, as well as help visually impaired people navigate a web page.

# Read: Class 05 Images, Color, Text

## HTML Media

1. A real world use case for the *alt* attribute being used in a website would be when the image it's attached to is not available, so users would see a brief description of what the image was displaying. Another use would be if the user is visually impaired and they are using a screen reader which can read the alt description for them.
2. Accessibility of images in an HTML document can be improved by using alt text and title.
3. The *figure* element would be useful in HTML as a semantic container for figures and to clearly link the figure to the caption.
4. The difference between a *gif* image and a *svg* image is that a *gif* support simple animation that is a series of images while an *svg* is a set of drawing commands that is mostly used for diagrams and icons.
5. The *png* image type would be used to display a screenshot because this format uses lossless compression.

## CSS

1. The difference between the foreground and background colors of an HTML element is that the foreground color defines the color of an HTML element's content while the background color defines the color of an element's background.
2. I would use the color property and the background-color property to add color to the HTML elements of the webpage.
3. When choosing fonts for an HTML document, font availability and web safe fonts should be considered.
4. *Font-size* sets the size of the font using varioud units such as em, rem, and px. *Font-weight* sets the boldness of the font. *Font-style* is used to italicize text.
5. Two ways that spacing could be added around characters displayed in an h1 element are by using the letter-spacing property or the word-spacing property.

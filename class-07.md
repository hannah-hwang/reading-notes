# Read: Class 07 Object, Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

## Domain Modeling

1. We need domain modeling because it can verify and validate the understaning of a specific problem. It is used as a model to implement new objects without repeating code.

## HTML Tables

1. Tables should not be used for page layouts because they reduce accessibility for visually impaired users and make it difficult for scren reader to interpret them, they involve many tags to produce which can make the code harder to maintain, and they need to be styled in way that would make them effective.
2. 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML \<table> are \<tr>, \<th>, and \<td>.

## Constructors

1. A *constructor* is a function which is used to create and apply new objects to set property values. Some advantages of using it are that you don't have to type out the same code for each new object you want to create.
2. The term *this* differs when used in an object literal and when used in a constructor in that in an object literal, it is used to refer to the current object the code is written inside, while in a constructor, it is allows you to create new objects using the same method.

## Prototypes

1. Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.

- At my job, there's a notebook that keeps track of any information we need to know about the job including basic rules and regulations, specific patient requests, etc. It's been used by multiple people before me who had updated and added to it as needed. I now refer to that notebook and make changes to it along the way.

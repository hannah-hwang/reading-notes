## Learn CSS - Flexbox

1. One-dimensional content when referring to a flexbox means that it takes lots of items of different sizes and returns the best layout for the items.
2. The difference between the main axis and the cross axis is the main axis is set by the *flex-direction* property, and the cross axis will be set to the opposite of the main axis.
3. Using certain properties of flexbox, such as the *row-reverse* and *column-reverse* properties, can negatively impact accessibility because reordering using these properties do not translate to logical order, which is the order that screen readers follow. This may make it difficult for people using screen readers to navigate through a web page.

## CSS Layout - Flexbox

 1. Some advantages to using flexbox over float are using flexbox allows you to create a flexible layout by being able to vertically center a block of content inside its parent, make all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, and make all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height.
 2. The topic of flexbox connects with my long term goals because I can apply what I learned about it to design web pages that are accessible and easy to navigate through. It also seems like a great way to organize content in a web page.
